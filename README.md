## Project Summary

This project exercise, created by The Odin Project, is a browser version of a
calculator. Some of the key functions implemented into this calculator are as
as follows:

* The add, subtract, multiply, and divide operators
* A "clear" button that erases all of the data inputted into the calculator
* A "delete" button that erases the last input
* A decimal button that only allows the user to input 1 decimal point

## Goals

For this project, I plan to create a simple yet UI-friendly calculator while
implementing logic in the most concise way possible. Whether it's using more
arrow functions, ternary operators, or built-in methods, I want to gain a
better understanding of these practices and improve the readability of my code.
